---- BUGS

[f=0007014] you have more than the lance supports in group #1 - still possible by player directly assigning groups

--[f=0032181] [Sound] Error: Unable to open audio file: sounds/fire-flame-burner.wav

some clan mechs with mismatched launchpoints due to weapon changes (cougar, warhawk, timberwolf)

PPCs & AC5 do no damage to MadDogs from the front, AoE not hitting origin

leftarm vs rightarm are reveresed in some models (Devastator, Atlas)

Sometimes build menu locks up (when you gain a C3? e.g. light pane doesn't work until you right click a medium to clear menu)

---- WISHLIST

random race?

--buildpics should show ECM / Jump / BAPs / AMS (NARC, TAG?)

Implement leg damage (& MASC?)

Salvage yard upgrade

non-magical wall delivery & repair

Make TAG & NARC increase missile accuracy / guidance

vehicles or BAs as AI controlled 'grunts'

include or GG shared script functions between Mech/Vehicle/Turret

sendtounsynced key events e.g. 'mech loses arm' to avoid polling rules params in widgets

---- BALANCE

HAG30 dps!

repair walls is ridiculously exploitable
