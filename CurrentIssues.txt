[f=0099197] <[S44]FLOZi> Aero units really don't like being delivered :(

-- units too expensive / production too limited

-- weird unit movement

-- "can't build upgrades on beacon that was capped dropzone"

[f=0009450] Error: LuaRules::RunCallIn: error = 2, UnitExperience, [string "LuaRules/Gadgets/unit_perks.lua"]:64: attempt to index field '?' (a nil value)

 
 [f=0007014] you have more than the lance supports in group #1 - still possible by player directly assigning groups
 
 top of ticket counter widget e.g. resources missing in certain window res
 
 bug with mechbay?
 
  -- Perks too cheap (0.5 -> 1.5)
 
 -- Osiris OP (C: 10780 -> 12780)
 
 -- Clan walkscripts - Mistlynx, Firemoth Hellbringer Iceferret Summoner have forward legs (awesome) [mistlynx & summoner require forward-leg jump anims]
 
 --deck showing enemy units due to fail use of SetUnitGroup in synced code -> MUST send to unsynced
 
 -- Clan radii too small: Warhawk, Timberwolf, Stormcrow, summoner
 
 Clan forward leg jump anim pushes into terrain (mistlynx, summoner)
 
 --Clan mechs & vehicles missing ammo
 
 some clan mechs with mismatched launchpoints due to weapon changes (cougar, warhawk, timberwolf)
 
 perking clears order queue
 
 add an "emergency get out" button to mechbay
 
 
dropzones interfere with beacon capping

towers self d doesn't increase limit
