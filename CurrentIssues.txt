---- BUGS
	
[f=0007014] you have more than the lance supports in group #1 - still possible by player directly assigning groups

--[f=0032181] [Sound] Error: Unable to open audio file: sounds/fire-flame-burner.wav

some clan mechs with mismatched launchpoints due to weapon changes (cougar, warhawk, timberwolf)

PPCs & AC5 do no damage to MadDogs from the front, AoE not hitting origin

--ticket counter widget doesn't respect user's /fps and /clock settings

Flamer doesn't always hit / add heat? -> caused by hitting limbs

unable to upgrade 'home' beacon when capped after team died?

Godde menu ordering bug



[f=0043000] Error: LuaRules::RunCallIn: error = 2, UnitDestroyed, [string "LuaRules/Gadgets/unit_beaconbuild.lua"]:344: attempt to index global 'env' (a nil value)
How can beaconID become nil?


---- WISHLIST

random race?

--buildpics should show ECM / Jump / BAPs / AMS (NARC, TAG?)

Implement leg damage

Salvage yard upgrade

non-magical wall delivery & repair, replace with dragons teeth 'fired' in a circle

Make TAG & NARC increase missile accuracy / guidance

vehicles or BAs as AI controlled 'grunts'

include or GG shared script functions between Mech/Vehicle/Turret

sendtounsynced key events e.g. 'mech loses arm' to avoid polling rules params in widgets

---- BALANCE

HAG30 dps!

repair walls is ridiculously exploitable
