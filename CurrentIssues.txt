---- BUGS

[f=0007014] you have more than the lance supports in group #1 - still possible by player directly assigning groups
 
top of ticket counter widget e.g. resources missing in certain window res
 
Clan forward leg jump anim pushes into terrain (mistlynx, summoner)

"Jump doesn't work a lot of the time" -> caused by having to turn to face jump

some clan mechs with mismatched launchpoints due to weapon changes (cougar, warhawk, timberwolf)


---- WISHLIST

buildpics should show ECM / Jump / BAPs / AMS (NARC, TAG?)

Salvage yard upgrade

non-magical wall delivery

vehicles or BAs as AI controlled 'grunts'


---- BALANCE

HAG30 dps!

repair walls is ridiculously exploitable
