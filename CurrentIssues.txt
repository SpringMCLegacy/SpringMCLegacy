---- BUGS
	
[f=0007014] you have more than the lance supports in group #1 - still possible by player directly assigning groups

--[f=0032181] [Sound] Error: Unable to open audio file: sounds/fire-flame-burner.wav

some clan mechs with mismatched launchpoints due to weapon changes (cougar, warhawk, timberwolf)

Godde menu ordering bug

capped vpad resulting in multiple LC at once

Avenger that 'bugs out' without unloading leads to beacon that cannot upgrade??

spambot can upgrade a dropzone

refactor Widgets/mcl_gui_narc_marker.lua

---- WISHLIST

--buildpics should show ECM / Jump / BAPs / AMS (NARC, TAG?)

Implement leg damage

Salvage yard upgrade

non-magical wall delivery & repair, replace with dragons teeth 'fired' in a circle

Make TAG & NARC increase missile accuracy / guidance

BA-filled APC

include or GG shared script functions between Mech/Vehicle/Turret

sendtounsynced key events e.g. 'mech loses arm' to avoid polling rules params in widgets

16:12 - [buffyverse] flozi: in the long term (polish! remember that buzzword?) we (ie. you) should make corpses with all possible lost limb combinations
16:13 - [buffyverse] flozi: so script can leave correct one


---- BALANCE

HAG30 dps!

repair walls is ridiculously exploitable
