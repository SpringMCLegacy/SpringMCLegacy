---- BUGS
	
some clan mechs with mismatched launchpoints due to weapon changes (cougar, warhawk, timberwolf)


Avenger that 'bugs out' without unloading leads to beacon that cannot upgrade??

spambot can upgrade a dropzone

refactor Widgets/mcl_gui_narc_marker.lua

---- WISHLIST

--buildpics should show ECM / Jump / BAPs / AMS (NARC, TAG?)

Implement leg damage

Salvage yard upgrade

non-magical wall delivery & repair, replace with dragons teeth 'fired' in a circle

Make TAG & NARC increase missile accuracy / guidance

include or GG shared script functions between Mech/Vehicle/Turret

sendtounsynced key events e.g. 'mech loses arm' to avoid polling rules params in widgets

16:12 - [buffyverse] flozi: in the long term (polish! remember that buzzword?) we (ie. you) should make corpses with all possible lost limb combinations
16:13 - [buffyverse] flozi: so script can leave correct one
