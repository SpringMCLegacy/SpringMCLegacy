Some new ideas:

:::: Only Dropship Landing Site ("Main Base") should have 3 outpost spots; the rest of the beacons are singular outpost points.

As stated.

:::: Automate AI vehicle population
Simply remove players being able to purchase LZ at outposts and replace by an automated system. Proposed idea: Have uncaptured beacons spawn hostile GAIA units until captured, 
at which point it spawns friendly units.


:::: Dropship are semi-permanent, remaining on the map until Mechs are ordered;

:::: Folding some previous Outposts into Dropship UPGRADES
Uplink, C3 (bleh), artillery strikes, aero sorties, plus additions like weapons (ie Overlord's artillery cannon);

:::: Condensing Outpost types into two categories: Defense and Support
DEFENSE:Fortified Bunker, upgradable with area denial functions;
	Turret Control, with a selection of 4 weapon types;

SUPPORT:EWAR Station that starts with BAP, can be upgraded with ECM and Seismic Sensor;
	Mech Bay, to repair Mechs, with upgrade options?;
	Recovery Station, to collect Salvage, can build additional BRVs;

:::: Introduce SALVAGE as a currency/resource, primarily used for UPGRADES on Mechs, Outposts and Dropships, and collected by Salvage Yards but also some other direct option. 
SALVAGE would become the primary currently for upgrading, but would also be used to swap Omnimech configs - Clan players can use Salvage to swap a Mech to a different config, rather
than have to buy a whole new Mech to adapt.

:::: Replace Inner Sphere mech "Skills" with Upgrades
As a counterpoint to Clan Omnimech ability, IS Mechs should be able to use SALVAGE to upgrade their Mechs, making them more focused and specialized while Clans are more adaptable.

:::: Skills can remain if there is some significant difference between a Pilot skill function and an Upgrade. Ideally an Upgrade should be something represented by physical addition
or modification of equipment, while Skill represents attributes.
